    Coding Assignment: Create a 10 key calculator (Functional Calculator with Clear, +, -, =, with display, TSX)
</h1>

<p align="center">
  Template for this code: https://github.com/reactivando/template-react-typescript
</p>

<p align="center">
  See src/App.tsx and src/components/Button for the code I actually wrote
</p>


This code is very rough and what I would consider only a first attempt with little styling. As it is you can enter in a calculation and select =. After this you should select clear to start from a fresh state.
Things I would change if I put more time into this:
<ol>
<li>Make this code more abstract. I focused on basic functionality and implementing just the Button from a separate file to demonstrate React/TypeScript. But I would also separate the display area and the numberpad into their own files</li>
<li>More in depth testing/debugging to make this calculator function as expected. As is this calculator is very.... unique, and full of fun... "features" that make it very interesting to use. </li>
</ol>
